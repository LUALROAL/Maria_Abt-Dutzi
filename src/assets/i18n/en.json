      "p1": "On July 29, 1952, I was born in Bogot치, the capital of Colombia, as the second daughter of academic painter Guillermo Malaver and his wife Margarita.",
      "p2": "When I was about 11 years old, my father discovered that I had inherited his talent. From that moment on, he regularly taught me oil and acrylic painting.",
      "p3": "In my training, he placed great emphasis on teaching me primarily our traditional Colombian painting technique, namely painting on velvet.",
      "p4": "The motifs of my figurative works are created in this painting technique solely through dots and not with brushstrokes, as the colors would otherwise mix.",
      "p5": "This South American painting style is practically unknown in Europe and differs in its effect on the viewer from the usual paintings that are painted exclusively on white canvas.",
      "p6": "As a gratitude to my father and mentor, I sign all my works to this day with the artistic name 'Malaver'.",
      "p7": "I first began studying psychopedagogy, but after one semester I realized that my true passion was painting.",
      "p8": "At the age of 26, I began working as an independent painter and during that time I held several exhibitions in my native country, including at:",
      "p9": "In 1992, I emigrated to Germany for love. Shortly after starting my new life in Germany, my first husband passed away from a serious illness.",
      "p10": "In 1994, I met my second husband, who encouraged me to resume my artistic activities.",
      "p11": "In recent years, I have sold my velvet paintings mainly to private individuals and through the online gallery 'Artquid', and later also in exhibitions at the following galleries:"
